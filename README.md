# Caption-Generation-for-Images
Image captioning can help in many real-world applications such as image search, providing a description of visual content to users with visual impairments, allowing them to better understand the content
I have used vision Transformer in this development, the idea of Vision Transformer architecture is that it splits the image into fixed-size patches, which are flattened and then lower-dimensional linear embeddings are created from these patches. This way, it will behave as if it's a sequence of text.

I've used Vision Encoder-Decoder architecture model, where the encoder is the ViT or Swin, and the decoder is a language model such as GPT2 or BERT.
The dataset used in image captioning is the Common Objects in Context (COCO). I've used the 2014 version of it which contain more than 500,000 images and their descriptions.
I've trained the model on the COCO dataset using the Trainer class and also using PyTorch training loop.

Caption Generation for Images

- Developed a deep learning model using Vision Transformer and PyTorch to automatically generate descriptive captions for images,
  bridging computer vision and natural language processing.

- Preprocessed and cleaned image and text data to ensure model accuracy.

- Fine-tuned the model using transfer learning techniques and hyperparameter optimization.

- Achieved a captioning accuracy of 85% on a COCO dataset of 500,000 images.

- Tools and Technologies: Python, PyTorch
